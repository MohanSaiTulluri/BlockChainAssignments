# Reflection

Building this small blockchain gave me a tangible feel for hashing, immutability, and Proof-of-Work (PoW). I learned that the hash of a block is not only calculated from its content but also from the previous block's hash. This design makes even a small change to any one of the blocks (e.g., a changed transaction number) invalidate all subsequent blocks, showing immutability. It was interesting to see how quickly a manipulated chain fails to verify.

Employing PoW taught me how blockchains are computationally secure. By requiring a hash to start with some amount of leading zeros, the system forces the miners to perform millions of hash operations before receiving a valid block. Increasing the difficulty level from 3 to 5 substantially increased nonce values and mining duration, illustrating that cost and security of forgery are directly controlled by PoW. To successfully alter a blockchain, an attacker would have to re-mine every subsequent block faster than the network's balance, which is essentially impossible to do at scale.

I was surprised most at how quickly a simple blockchain becomes computationally expensive. With less than five blocks and a difficulty level of 5, my CPU was already struggling to keep up. This also made it clear to me why real-world blockchains like Bitcoin require massive mining capacity. I also enjoyed how important consensus rules are: without PoW, it would be easy for anyone to alter the chain. Overall, this project gave me a much deeper understanding of how hashing and PoW work together to secure and trust decentralized networks.
